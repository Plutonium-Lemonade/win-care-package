# Windows 11 PC Care Package

## Scope
This script is intended to automate a large portion of the Windows 11 setup process and remove much of the bloat that comes out of the box.

> **Use with caution**  
> This script is tested and working as of 2025-08-11 with no breaking changes to the latest version of Windows 11 but holds no guarantee that will remain the case with future updates.

## Usage

2. Run the script either through the same session, or right-click and "Run with PowerShell". The script will automatically return the execution policy to `undefined` after running.
